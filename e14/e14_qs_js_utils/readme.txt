This is not game bot!

 * It's very easy for me to do these things, which i mess
 * around with these scripts, realy automatically
 * (auto-commit order without displaying (or auto-closing)
 * order summary, monitor status of transports and auto-start
 * production after they are delivered to the workshop).
 
 * But purpose of these scripts is NOT to create automated bot
 * (i would be using better things then JavaScript for that).
 * These scripts exists because i don't like clicking tooooo much,
 * or i'm not so good with my memory and so on.
 * All of them should follow the rule, that one user action
 * does at most one game action/event.

Example:
 * Click -> buy, click->buy, ... not click -> buy,buy,buy
 * and so on!
