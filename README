My usefull(?) userJS/css tweaks for few web sites.

You can find here:
* UlozTo enhancements (currently only thumbnailer, more still to be ported)
Probably dead services or outdated:
* Mu.FunFirst.cz - Clear login form (to enable creds autocompletion)
* webgames:
** Europe1400 (The Guild)
** Molehill Empire (Wurzelimperium / Zelene Imperium)

Usage depends on your browser.
Learn how to add userJS for specific website into your browser.
See http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/ for Opera or http://scriptish.org/ for Firefox.
For Chromium/Google Chrome it may work, but when needed i'll add Chrome Extension manifest.
